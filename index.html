<h3>
This is site is simple, unlike our love.
</h3>
<pre>
It feels, I met you yesterday
You were the one I could never see
You loved me too, without pay
My heart, for you it would not be

I held fast for our love to swell
But dark times, for they lie ahead
But for my love, she would not dwell
On a past that has already bled

We ride the roller coaster high
I am scared and excited
You are calm, bring love to my eye
But of you, I was too frightened

Now I understand a real fear
Do not know how the story ends
That I will never see or hear
Your sweet words of love again
</pre>

<p>
Love forever, Drew
